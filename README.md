# CPUScheduler

Implementing different CPU scheduling algorithms using C# programming language.

This project was done as a part of the Operating Systems undergraduate course at Computer and Systems Engineering Department, Faculty of Engineering, ASU(Spring 2013).

The code implements the following CPU Scheduling Algorithms:

###(1) FCFS
###(2) SJF (preemptive / Non preemptive)
###(3) Priority (preemptive /Non preemptive)
###(4) Round Robin

using Linked List to represent the ready Queue. The inputs would be (Process ID, Burst time, Arrival Time , Priority, Quantum). One can take these inputs from a File or inserted manually during run time. The output is required to be the sequence of process execution with the related calculations of (Average waiting time and Average turnaround Time).

An Excel file contains the inputs of the program , the program reads that inputs directly after adding the correct path of the Excel file on your own machine and pressing the button "Load".
